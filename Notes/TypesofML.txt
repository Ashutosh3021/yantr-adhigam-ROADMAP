NOTE: data is primerily of 2 types
            1. numeric (e.g. age,wt)
            2. catagoric    (e.g. gender,yes/no question)

## Supervised:
---
We have to establish a relation between input Column and output column to predict some Other Output columns for the given input columns.
- Classification
If the output column is in the category data format then it is called as Classification.
- Regration
If the output column is in numeric data format then it is called regression.

## Unsupervised:
---
We have only input columns we do not have the output columns In this case.
