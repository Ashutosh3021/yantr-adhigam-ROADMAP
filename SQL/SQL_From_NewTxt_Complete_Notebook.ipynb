    "## 1. Grouping Data with GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:** GROUP BY groups rows sharing the same values in specified columns, enabling aggregate operations like counting or summing per group—this is essential for summarizing data, such as finding top actors by movie count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanism:** First, create groups based on a column (e.g., actor); then apply aggregates (e.g., COUNT of movies) to each group. Building on basic SELECT, this transforms raw data into summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** To find top 5 actors by number of movies:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT actor, COUNT(*) AS num_movies \n",
    "FROM movies \n",
    "GROUP BY actor \n",
    "ORDER BY num_movies DESC \n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This groups all movies by actor, counts per group (e.g., Mithun Chakraborty tops), sorts descending, and limits to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Handles repetitive analysis efficiently; without grouping, you'd manually tally each actor's movies across thousands of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregates:**\n",
    "- `COUNT(*)` counts rows per group; similarly, `SUM(worldwide_income - budget)` for total profit per genre, `AVG` for averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aggregate Function | Purpose | Example Output |\n",
    "|-------------------|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| `COUNT(*)` | Rows per group | Actor movies: 38 for Akshay Kumar |\n",
    "| `SUM(expression)` | Total per group | Genre total profit |\n",
    "| `AVG(expression)` | Average per group | Average profit per director |\n",
    "| `MIN/MAX` | Extremes per group | Min/max budget per genre |\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Key Insight:** After GROUP BY, non-grouped columns require aggregates; otherwise, only one value per group is arbitrary."

    "## 2. Filtering Groups with HAVING\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:** HAVING filters after GROUP BY, unlike WHERE (which filters before); use for group-level conditions like \"average screens > threshold.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanism:** GROUP BY first → aggregates computed → HAVING applied → results filtered. Connects to GROUP BY by acting on group summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Actors with average opening screens > 2000:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT actor, AVG(opening_screens) \n",
    "FROM movies \n",
    "GROUP BY actor \n",
    "HAVING AVG(opening_screens) > 2000 \n",
    "ORDER BY AVG(opening_screens) DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Outputs recent actors like Deepika Padukone (3701 avg).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Enables complex analytics, e.g., high-performers only; WHERE can't filter aggregates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nuance:** Improves readability in multi-line queries; no CHECK constraint confusion (CHECK is for table creation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Warning:** WHERE before GROUP BY (row-level); HAVING after (group-level)—common mix-up leads to errors."

    "\n",
    "**Concept:** DELETE removes rows (conditional); TRUNCATE deletes all (faster, no WHERE).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanism:** `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Single: DELETE FROM passengers WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "-- Complex: WHERE id > 2 AND email LIKE '%yahoo%';\n",
    "-- All: DELETE FROM passengers; or TRUNCATE TABLE passengers;\n",

    "## 11. Database Fundamentals: Why Use Databases Over Files?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:** Databases are structured systems designed to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently, addressing limitations of file-based storage for applications like websites and software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties (ACID-like qualities):** Databases ensure Integrity (data accuracy and consistency), Consistency (uniform data across views, e.g., user profiles always available), Availability (data accessible cross-platform like web, Android, iOS), Independence (applications don't depend on physical data structure), and Currency (latest updates visible to all users).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why they matter:** These properties prevent issues like inconsistent user data on social networks or mismatched profiles across apps; violations lead to errors or downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data is costly:** Reading/writing operations are expensive; real-world example: a student maxed out WhatsApp quality settings, shared widely, causing massive bills—highlighting data management costs in industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Limitations (Why Not Files?):** Files lack structure (program depends on physical format, e.g., parsing email/password with delimiters), complex retrieval (open/search entire file), poor concurrency (multiple users corrupt data), no fine-grained access control (all-or-nothing access), and redundancy (repetition wastes space).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Storing passwords in text files forces custom parsing (e.g., delimiter between email/password), risking errors if format changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Files:** Offline storage (e.g., WhatsApp chat history readable without internet), overwrite-heavy data (e.g., city sensors updating every 5 minutes, discard old), logs (non-critical, sequential crash dumps).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection:** Files suffice for simple, low-concurrency needs but fail for web/apps requiring ACID properties—leading to databases as the solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Concept:** DDL (Data Definition Language) manages database structure: CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Concept:** Constraints enforce rules on data insertion/updates, maintaining integrity during CREATE or ALTER. Six main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Constraint | Purpose | Example Syntax | Effect if Violated |\n",
    "|------------|---------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| NOT NULL | Column cannot be empty | `name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL` | Rejects NULL inserts |\n",
    "| UNIQUE | No duplicate values in column | `email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE` | Blocks duplicates, allows one NULL |\n",
    "| PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier (NOT NULL + UNIQUE) | `id INT PRIMARY KEY` or `PRIMARY KEY (id)` | Rejects duplicates/NULL; auto-indexed |\n",
    "| FOREIGN KEY | Links to another table's PK | `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)` | Prevents orphans; blocks deletes if referenced |\n",
    "| DEFAULT | Auto-fills if no value | `gender VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'Male'` | Inserts default on omit |\n",
    "| AUTO_INCREMENT | Auto-increments numeric PK | `id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY` | Next insert gets +1 (e.g., 1,2,3...) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**How PRIMARY KEY works:** Two ways—inline (`id INT PRIMARY KEY`) or separate (`PRIMARY KEY (id)`); composite possible (multi-column).\n",
    "\n",
    "**FOREIGN KEY Example:** Orders table references Users(id); deleting user fails if orders exist (protects referential integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**DEFAULT Example:** `CREATE TABLE passenger (..., join_time DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);` auto-fills current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applying Later:** `ALTER TABLE passenger ADD CONSTRAINT uk_email UNIQUE (email);`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dropping Constraints:** `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX constraint_name;` (rebuild table if needed).\n",

    "**Concept:** SQL divides queries into four major categories, essential for all database work: Data Definition Language (DDL) for defining database structure, Data Manipulation Language (DML) for handling data, Transaction Control Language (TCL) for managing transactions, and Data Control Language (DCL) for permissions. These form the foundation—master them first because DDL structures your data, DML populates and queries it, TCL ensures changes are atomic (all or nothing), and DCL secures access.\n",

    "|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **DDL** (Data Definition Language) | Define/modify database schema | CREATE (create objects), ALTER (modify), DROP (delete), TRUNCATE (empty data) | CREATE TABLE to build tables; DROP DATABASE to remove a database |\n",
    "| **DML** (Data Manipulation Language) | Manipulate data rows | INSERT (add rows), UPDATE (modify), DELETE (remove), SELECT (retrieve) | SELECT * FROM users to fetch data—the most frequent command |\n",
    "| **TCL** (Transaction Control Language) | Control transaction integrity | COMMIT (save changes), ROLLBACK (undo) | COMMIT after successful updates in a Python app; ROLLBACK if errors occur |\n",

    "**Concept:** SQL uses data types like programming languages (e.g., Python's int, str), but implementations vary across DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL. In MySQL (focus here), common types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CHAR(n)` or `VARCHAR(n)`: Fixed/variable-length strings (e.g., names up to 255 chars)\n",
    "- `INT`: Integers (e.g., customer ID)\n",
    "- `DECIMAL(p,s)` or `FLOAT/DOUBLE`: Precise decimals (e.g., ratings like 4.2)\n",
    "- `DATE, TIME, DATETIME`: Temporal data\n",
    "- `BLOB`: Binary large objects (files, images)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why variations matter:** MySQL has TINYINT (0-255), but Oracle might differ—check w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp for DBMS-specific lists. Use VARCHAR(255) for emails/addresses to avoid overflow; INT for IDs to enable math/search."
